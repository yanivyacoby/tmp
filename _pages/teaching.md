### Courses

<hr/>

**As a course developer & instructor:** 
* [CS290A & CS290B](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}: Effective Research Practices & Academic Culture (Fall 2021 - Spring 2023).

  I **created** a new syllabus that focuses on skill building (e.g. how to read research papers), soft-skill building (e.g. managing advising relationships, how to support your peers), and academic culture (e.g. mental health in academia, normalizing and de-stigmatizing of mental health needs, discussion of power dynamics in scientific communities). Find out more in our [SIGCSE paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12650){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. CS290's complete teaching materials can be found [here](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290-teaching-materials){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

**As a teaching fellow:** I previously served as a teaching fellow for a number of courses at Harvard:
* CS281: Advanced Machine Learning (Fall 2018)
* CS61: Systems Programming and Machine Organization (Fall 2015)
* CS50: Intro to Computer Science I (Fall 2012)

### Research Mentorship

<hr/>

I serve(d) as a direct **research mentor** for ~20 students at all levels -- undergraduate, Master's, and Ph.D. -- enrolled in the following courses (or continuing their projects after):
* [AC297r](https://www.capstone.iacs.seas.harvard.edu/): Computational Science and Engineering Capstone Project (Fall 2022)
* [AM207](https://onefishy.github.io/am207/): Stochastic Methods for Data Analysis -- Inference and Optimization (Fall 2019 - Spring 2022)

### Community Building, Outreach & Advocacy

<hr/>

**Leadership:**
* I served as a **co-leader** of (Spring 2022 - Fall 2022) and **peer mentor** (Spring 2021 - Spring 2023) in [InTouch](https://intouch.seas.harvard.edu/), a peer-to-peer support network for graduate students. 
* I was nominated to represent Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences on the [Student Wellbeing Council](https://www.harvard.edu/wellbeing/about/) (Fall 2022 - Present). 

**Outreach:**
* I served as a **mentor** for a Ph.D. Working Group (Fall 2021), where I helped students write personal statements, CVs, and practice interviewing. I also helped debunk common myths about Ph.D. programs that often provoke imposter syndrome / cause students to self-filter during the application process.
* Lastly, I was a **mentor** for the [Women in Data Science (WiDS) Cambridge datathon workshop](https://onefishy.github.io/wids_datathon/) (2019 and 2020). 

**Talks and workshops:**
* I **developed and co-organized** a workshop at NYU's Center for Data Science, "Everything I wish I knew as I navigated the Ph.D.", that builds community via discussion and reflection about of how academic culture and mental health are intertwined. The workshop was used to jump-start a student well-being advocacy group. 
* I **developed and ran** a workshop about inclusive teaching for [CS181](https://harvard-ml-courses.github.io/cs181-web/)'s teaching fellow retreat (Spring 2023). The workshop highlights the way societal misconceptions shape students' expectations and negatively impact the learning environment in technical computer science classes and especially in AI.
* I **created and ran** a workshop, "The Art and Science of Struggle" (Fall 2022), for the Master's program at Harvard's Institute of Applied Computational Sciences. The workshop is about productive vs. unproductive struggle, how our misconceptions of science lead to unproductive struggle and systemically hinder us from building a supportive and inclusive communities, and how to support our peers.
* I **created and organized** a workshop for first-year Ph.D. students at Harvard SEAS, called [How to make the most out of your Ph.D: a guide from current to incoming students](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/a-guide-to-your-phd/guide.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} (Fall 2020). The workshop is about exposing the "hidden curriculum" of doctoral programs.
