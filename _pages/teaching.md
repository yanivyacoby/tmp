### Courses

<hr/>

**As a course developer & instructor:** 
* [CS290A & CS290B](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}: Effective Research Practices & Academic Culture (Fall 2021 - Spring 2023).

  I **created** a new syllabus that focuses on skill building (e.g. how to read research papers), soft-skill building (e.g. managing advising relationships, how to support your peers), and academic culture (e.g. mental health in academia, normalizing and de-stigmatizing of mental health needs, discussion of power dynamics in scientific communities). Find out more in our [paper about CS290](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12650){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

**As a teaching fellow:** I previously served as a teaching fellow for a number of courses at Harvard:
* CS281: Advanced Machine Learning (Fall 2018)
* CS61: Systems Programming and Machine Organization (Fall 2015)
* CS50: Intro to Computer Science I (Fall 2012)

### Research Mentorship

<hr/>

I serve(d) as a direct **research mentor** for ~20 students at all levels -- undergraduate, Master's, and Ph.D. -- enrolled in the following courses (or continuing their projects after):
* [AC297r](https://www.capstone.iacs.seas.harvard.edu/): Computational Science and Engineering Capstone Project (Fall 2022)
* [AM207](https://onefishy.github.io/am207/): Stochastic Methods for Data Analysis -- Inference and Optimization (Fall 2019 - Spring 2022)

### Community Building & Outreach

<hr/>

I **created and organized** a workshop for first-year Ph.D. students at Harvard SEAS, called [How to make the most out of your Ph.D: a guide from current to incoming students](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/a-guide-to-your-phd/guide.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} (Fall 2020). The workshop is about managing the multi-faceted (and often undiscussed) challenges of being a Ph.D. student. 

I'm a **co-leader** of (Spring 2022 - present) and **peer mentor** (Spring 2021 - present) in [InTouch](https://intouch.seas.harvard.edu/), a peer-to-peer support network for graduate students.

I served as a **mentor** for a Ph.D. Working Group, where I helped students write personal statements, CVs, and practice interviewing. I also helped debunk common myths about Ph.D. programs that often provoke imposter syndrome / cause students to self-filter during the application process.

Lastly, I was a **mentor** for the [Women in Data Science (WiDS) Cambridge datathon workshop](https://onefishy.github.io/wids_datathon/) (2019-2020).
