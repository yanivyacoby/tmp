I'm an **Assistant Professor** of Computer Science at [Wellesley College](https://wellesley.edu/), where I lead the [Model-Guided Uncertainty (MOGU) Lab](https://mogu-lab.github.io/). My research focuses on developing new machine learning methods to advance the understanding, prediction, and prevention of suicide and related behaviors.

Before joining Wellesley, I was a **postdoctoral fellow** at the [Nock Lab](https://nocklab.fas.harvard.edu/) in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University and Mass General Hospital. I completed my **Ph.D.** in Machine Learning at the [Data to Actionable Knowledge Lab](https://dtak.github.io/) (DtAK) at Harvard, working with Professor [Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/). I had the pleasure of interning with the [Biomedical-ML team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/biomedical-ml/) at Microsoft Research New England (Summer 2021). Lastly, I received a **Master's of Music** in Contemporary Improvisation from the [New England Conservatory](https://necmusic.edu/dual-degree-programs) (2016) and a **Bachelor's of Arts** in Computer Science from Harvard University (2015). I am currently a performing [musician](/music).

## Research

My goal is to empower individuals to effectively utilize Machine Learning by making the consequences of modeling assumptions and inference decisions transparent.
Specifically, I develop deep probabilistic/Bayesian models and approximate inference methods designed for safety-critical domains, such as precision healthcare.
My work has exposed failure mechanisms in a number of popular methods, and provides ways to mitigate these failures.
My work has also explored how people (mis)understand popular techniques for explainable AI.


## Teaching

My goal is to create classroom environments and mentorship experiences that (a) build student ability to independently interrogate technological systems in societal contexts, (b) that develop effective research skills (e.g. technical reading, writing, communication), and (c) help students overcome common psychological barriers to learning (e.g. imposter phenomenon) using cohort-building and discussion of academic culture. See my [here](/advocacy) for more info.
