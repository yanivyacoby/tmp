I'm a **Ph.D. candidate** in Machine Learning at Harvard University, 
working with Professor [Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/)
at the [Data to Actionable Knowledge Lab](https://dtak.github.io/) (DtAK).
I had the pleasure of interning with the [Biomedical-ML team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/biomedical-ml/) at Microsoft Research New England (Summer 2021).

Before joining DtAK, I received a **Master's of Music** in Contemporary Improvisation from the [New England Conservatory](https://necmusic.edu/dual-degree-programs) (2016) and a **Bachelor's of Arts** in Computer Science from Harvard University (2015). I am currently a performing [musician](http://yanivyacoby.com/).

I've also completed summer internships at Uber (2016), [Kensho](https://www.kensho.com/) (2015), and Meta (2013).


## Research

My goal is to empower individuals to effectively utilize Machine Learning by making the consequences of modeling assumptions and inference decisions transparent.
Specifically, I develop deep probabilistic/Bayesian models and approximate inference methods designed for safety-critical domains, such as precision healthcare.
My work has exposed failure mechanisms in a number of popular methods, and provides ways to mitigate these failures.
My work has also explored how people (mis)understand popular techniques for explainable AI.


## Teaching

My goal is to create classroom environments and mentorship experiences that (a) build student ability to independently interrogate technological systems in societal contexts, (b) that develop effective research skills (e.g. technical reading, writing, communication), and (c) help students overcome common psychological barriers to learning (e.g. imposter phenomenon) using cohort-building and discussion of academic culture. See my [teaching & mentorship](/teaching) page for more info.
