		Accordionist/singer <a href="http://sunnivabrynnel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunniva Brynnel</a> and bouzouki player Yaniv Yacoby met at the New England Conservatory, Boston. They are both immensely passionate about learning folk tunes; they also share a passion for cluttering their respective homesteads with new and exciting instruments which they are learning to play. Sunniva studied Irish traditional music at DIT -- Conservatory Of Music And Drama in Dublin, and Yaniv has made several trips to Ireland to immerse himself in its folk music.
